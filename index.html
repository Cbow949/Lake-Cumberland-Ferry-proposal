    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p>Proposed Lake Cumberland ferry courses </p>

   <h> Author: Casey R. Bowlin </h>
   <p> made using QGIS v. 3.32 </p>
    <h1> Overview </h1>
    <p> The maps included offer a proposed course for the ferry service that visits five marinas on Lake Cumberland chosen due to both the compatibility with ferry services (i.e. sufficiently sized docks) and their proximity to local businesses.  </p>
