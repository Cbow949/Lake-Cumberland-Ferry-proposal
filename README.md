MAP 671 Final Project 

Overview 

The purpose of this mapping project is to provide some suggested courses for a potential tourist attraction on Lake Cumberland. 
Growing up on Lake Cumberland, in Clinton County, I am very familiar with the Lake and itsâ€™ surrounding communities. One of the greatest sources of revenue comes from annual incoming tourists during the Summer and early Fall seasons. Local businesses pull out all the stops, raise prices, and hold events to encourage visitors to visit them during their stay. That being said, Clinton County is only one of several other communities that border Lake Cumberland, and every year, the town misses out on tens of thousands of dollars to other counties that can offer visitors more amenities and events. 

In order to curb some of this loss, I would propose that Clinton County offer a vehicle and passenger ferry service, so that visitors may experience the benefits that these other communities offer, while simultaneously taking advantage of the competitively priced lodging available in Clinton County. 

Contents  

The maps included offer a proposed course for the ferry service that visits five marinas on Lake Cumberland chosen due to both the compatibility with ferry services (i.e. sufficiently sized docks) and their proximity to local businesses. One map included in this project is from Google Satellite, with overlayed proposed courses between marinas. The second map is a georeferenced map from URL: https://www.boatus.com/expert-advice/expert-advice-archive/2019/august/exploring-lake-cumberland-a-boaters-playground. The georeferenced map is slightly askew from the satellite image, despite using coordinate data for the georeferencing. This initially made me want to choose another topic for my project, but I decided to stick with it to show how two different maps may be able to relay the same information. I have included an additional map using satellite imagery to show how the satellite and georeferenced courses vary. 
Lastly, I have included an additonal map from URL: https://statedock.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Lake-Cumberland-Map-2018.pdf which shows a comprehensive map of Lake Cumberland docks and includes nautical mileage.

Methods 

The Satellite map include was created using Google Satellite with added scratch raster layers to plot courses between marinas. The boatus map was georeferenced to the original map with an additional scratch raster layer to plot the same courses. 

All maps include a legend, course plots, titles, and North markers.
